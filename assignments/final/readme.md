# CSC-496 Final Project

## Title
The title of my final is **Crabby's Beach Bonanza**. I went with your advice to think of the project as a game, and made a game.

## Five Interconnected Aspects
1. The x position of the mouse corresponds to the movement and position of the crab player.
2. When a player collides with a falling object, it is spliced from it's respective array and disappears.
3. When a player collides with a falling object, the point total is updated and displayed on screen.
4. When a player collides with certain objects, it makes a different synth noise depending on the object.
5. A player must press the space bar to bypass the start screen and begin playing the game. The player can also press space to pause the game
6. There is a timer for the game that updates with text live for the player to view, and also makes a synth sound each time it decrements.
7. When the timer hits zero, the game is automatically stopped entirely, and gives a text output to the player with their score and asks if they would like to play again
8. There is a replay button that the player can click with the mouse to play the game 
9. The replay button, when restarting the game, also keeps track of your all-time points across all plays and that textis displayed to the player

I think the one that produced the most interesting effect is the different synth tones that change with the obejcts you collide with. The sound when you hit the plastic bottle is lower than the sound for the timer, with the two synths for the coconut and margarita are set higher, with the margarita being highst as it has the highest point value. The bottle s below as it lowers your score. I was originally going to also put music behind the game, but I liked the sound of the various synth point cues so much I did not. I also wanted to have a higher cue for the highest point value so the player absolutely knows when the scored the high point item because of the dopamine release when our brain is presented with a reward sound.

## Multimedia
1. Images (Coconut, Margarita, Crab, Palm Tree)
2. Sound (Various Synth)
3. Webcam(The sand of the beach is made up of the pixels of the webcam with the color mapped to yellow/orange. Wanted to try to incorporate webcam in a creative way and not just plop the players face somewhere in the project)

## Allowed to Publically Share?
You can absolutely share any of my projects that I have submitted this semester. If I am being honest, if you were to share any of mine I am much prouder of my particles and fractals assignments than this one simply because they are more "artistic" but **Crabby's Beach Bonanza** is awesome as well.
